# STAT381-Project-4
STAT381, spring 2023.
Fourth project for the course.
The project creates a graph, while I identify details such as what is happening within a standard normal distribution. This then shows two images, one about the standard normal distribution density function, and a normal CDF function. It is essentially a statistics exercise.
